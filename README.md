This repo was created for a job interview


# Time spent :
- saturday : 8h
- sunday : 6h
- monday : 2h

You can check with all my commits

# Framework :
- Dagger 2
- Room
- Pagging 3 => to have an endless recycler (first time I used this). I did not implemented the retry functionnality
- Flow
- DataBinding => I really used it only on the userDetailsFragment to show that I can used it.
- Retrofit
- Mockito / Espresso 
- Glide / Lottie => to load images and animations

An application cannot be perfect in 2 days ! so here some of what I could improve / should have done
# Improvement :
- Add an progress bar when we are waiting for new value 
- Finish the UserDetailsFragment : I kknow I did not put all element but. I wanted to focus on more complexe pb than displaying an email in a textview
- Put all nationalities ! Sorry I was laszy to find all flags on internet ! And like the previous I wanted to focus on the pagging lib.
- Test the HomeFragment. I am really ashame that I did not tested all class. 
- Improve the quality of my image => first for the witdh and height. Second I should have convert it to webp.
- Have only one ViewModel : when I design the architecture I did not plan that one viewModel would be enough. Now I see that as the project was small one VM could have done it
- Dagger 2

# Conclusion :
I am happy with what I have done in only 2 days. This app is far from perfect yet. 
I wanted to used some new framework also because I think this is really what an interview is about.
